I created this boilerplate for developing plugins that based on wordpress core
automation with gulp;


**features** :
- Sass
- autoprefixer
- Babel
- SassDoc
- uglify
- sourcemaps
- composer
- npm
- image minification

**Commands:**
- `gulp prod` make fires ready for production
- `gulp watch`
- `gulp js` transpile es6 to es5
- `gulp sass` compile sass 
- `gulp image` minify the images
usage :
- 
`git clone` from files then `npm install` and `composer install` then you can use commands
have fun!
